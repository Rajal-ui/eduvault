## Overview

EduVault is a student office management system built to replace manual record-keeping for a college department. It manages student profiles, marksheets, fee receipts, exam results, and disciplinary records — all secured behind role-based authentication.

**Current version:** Desktop application (Python + Tkinter + MySQL)  
**In progress:** Migrating to a full-stack web application (FastAPI + React + Docker)

---

## Features

- **Role-based login** — Separate Admin and Student dashboards
- **Student management** — Full CRUD for profiles, marks, fees, exam results
- **Fee tracking** — Receipt management with payment status (Paid / Pending / Overdue)
- **Exam records** — GPA, semester results, distinction/ATKT tracking
- **Miscellaneous records** — Warnings, leave approvals, attendance notes
- **Secure auth** — bcrypt password hashing, credentials via environment variables
